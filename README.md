## Pizza Menu 
##### This project is a menu used to order pizza with various selection of toppings.

##### price for the order based on user selections.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
##### I created a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with JavaScript. A move is randomly 
##### generated by the computer and then the user repsonds with a move. Computer 
##### and user play back and forth until winner is reached and celebrated with music.
##### Game is automatically reset to place computers move randomly to initiate new game.


## Calculator
##### This is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, divide and multiply
#####  on a sleek, retro web version of a calculator.


## To-Do App
##### This is a simple, straight forward To-Do list app that allows user to 
##### input tasks to accomplish and be out put into list form. They can then 
##### click on said task that was accomplished and move onto new item on list.
